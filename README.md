# Consumer-Ad-Hoc-Insights

This repository houses the complete code and SQL queries crafted for the Consumer Goods domain as part of the Data Analytics Bootcamp by Codebasics. The project revolves around an in-depth analysis of a dataset from AtliQ Hardwares, a globally recognized leader in PC hardware, printers, mice, and computers. The primary objective is to tackle ten dynamic ad hoc business queries using SQL, extracting actionable insights to drive data-driven decision-making. This repository serves as a testament to my analytical approach, problem-solving skills, and expertise in SQL
